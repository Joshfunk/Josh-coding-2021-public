<h2 align=center>Breath of the wild</h2>


<p> Breath of the wild has a lot of beautiful atmospheric piano compositions to fit its vast map, the music of botw is never meant to intrude on the player, it does everything it can to enhance the games many environments, here are some of my favourites.</p>

 <h2 align=center> Undertale</h2>
 <P> Toby Fox was the composer of the Game undertale, and all of its music, his music, like his game, is rich in personality, every song is very memorable and each one is different. </P>

<h2 align=center>Sunset overdrive</h2>
<br>
Sunset overdrive is a fast-paced-rock-and-roll-death-metal-parkour-zombie-shooter, and  the best one i've ever played. The soundtrack to sunset isn't epic, or atmosperic. But it is very fun and motivated, and really gets you in the murdering mood.<br><br>
